Hello, my name is Tam Minh Phan and I am currently a postdoc at Kunsan National University. My main area of expertise is in roads and pavement, with a focus on researching new technologies that can be applied to improve road and highway performance.

In addition to my work in the field of roads and pavement, I also have a keen interest in developing technical computer programs. I have experience conducting and analyzing the performance of asphalt concrete, and have even developed a black ice prediction program to help improve road safety during hazardous weather conditions.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy spending my free time conducting research on cutting-edge technologies that can be applied to roads and highways. I also have a strong interest in image analysis and applying this technology to help improve road safety and performance.

Overall, I am passionate about using my skills and expertise to improve road infrastructure and safety, and I am excited to continue my work in this field in the years to come.
