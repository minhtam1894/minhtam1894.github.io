My name is Tam Minh Phan, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at Kunsan National University, specializing in roads and pavement. My research focuses on exploring innovative technologies to enhance road and highway performance. In addition, I possess a keen interest in developing technical computer programs, having expertise in analyzing the performance of asphalt concrete and developing a black ice prediction program for improving road safety in hazardous weather conditions.

During my free time, I enjoy researching advanced technologies for road and highway applications, particularly image analysis, and deep learing, which have the potential to improve road performance and safety. My passion lies in utilizing my skills and knowledge to improve road infrastructure and safety, and I am looking forward to continuing my work in this field in the future.
