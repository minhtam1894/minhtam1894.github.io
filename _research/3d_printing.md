This study introduces an asphalt crack sealing method using 3D printing technique. The Delta type of 3D printer was utilized crack sealing capacity of asphalt pavement. Python programing language was used to control applications of asphalt binder in 3D printer. Meanwhile, the temperature of binder and nozzle were controlled by Arduino. Several asphalt asphalt binder materials were examined to determine the optimum binder in terms of crack sealing. Three different types of asphalt binder were considered including PG 58-22, PG 64-22, and PG 82-22. The properties of crack sealed asphalt samples were investigated by indirect tensile strength test. In general, the results indicated that crack sealed asphalt presented a better results than that of asphalt sample without sealing. The crack sealed sample was approximately 20% higher, while the fracture energy was more 90% higher than sample without sealing. In addition, crack filled presented a more ductile behavior than that of control sample. Finally, the current study recommended PG 58-22 as an optimum asphalt binder in terms of crack sealing by 3D printing technique.
