The first stage of study aimed to develop a black ice prediction model using weather forecast and GIS data while the second study investigated two methods for detecting black ice. The rain sensor and deep learning methods were explored, considering environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air voids in asphalt concrete. The rain sensor method showed that the electrical resistance involved cooling time and reached a constant value when black ice was formed. On the other hand, the deep learning method achieved 90% accuracy in detecting black ice. Additionally, experiments using infrared heating confirmed that environmental temperature affects the melting time and melting area of black ice. Both studies aim to improve safety for drivers and reduce the risk of accidents caused by black ice.

Tam M. Phan et al., . "Black Ice Prediction Model for Road Pavement Using Weather Forecast Data And GIS Database"

> Black ice is a thin coating of ice on the road surface, which strongly reduces friction at the tire-road surface, resulting in dangerous driving when it happens. An appropriate diagnostic black ice could prevent traffic accidents as well as timely notice to drivers. Therefore, this study aims to develop a black ice prediction model to diagnose the probability of black ice formation. Serval combinations that can form road ice were considered, including freezing rain, hoar frost, freezing of wet roads. In addition, black ice risky index (BRI) was computed to reflect the probability of black ice formation. To acquire a fast prediction and high accuracy, the existing Geographical Information System (GIS) database and meteorological data were utilized. GIS database includes road geometry and location of automatic weather stations, while the meteoritical data consists of air temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud cover.  The model was developed based on the Python programming language. A 5-km road condition was observed from December 1st to December 31st, 2021, to determine the modelâ€™s accuracy. Based on the results from the prediction model, black ice formation was verified when the BRI was higher than 0.8. The model may be useful to develop black ice diagnostic program.

## Article 2

Tam M. Phan et al., "Impact of air voids and environmental temperature of asphalt concrete on black ice"

> This study investigates two methods for detecting black ice, a hazardous thin layer of ice on road surfaces. The rain sensor and deep learning methods were explored, while considering the influence of environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and air voids in asphalt concrete, on black ice formation. Results from the rain sensor method showed that the electrical resistance involved cooling time and reached a constant value when black ice was formed. Lower air voids in asphalt concrete led to a higher chance of black ice formation, while humidity had a negligible effect. A vehicle module for detecting black ice was successfully developed using deep learning with 90% accuracy. Furthermore, experiments using infrared heating confirmed that environmental temperature affects the melting time and melting area of black ice. These findings can improve safety for drivers and help with route planning when travelling on black ice roads.
